  <h1>Privacy Policy for G Task Express</h1>

  <p>G Task Express ("the extension") values your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information we
    collect, how we use it, and the measures we take to protect your data.</p>

  <h2>Information We Access</h2>
  <p>The extension requires access to your Google Task lists to provide its functionality. Specifically, the extension
    accesses:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your Google Task lists to display them in the extension popup and in the right-click menu.</li>
    <li>The ability to create new Google Tasks on your behalf.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>The extension uses your Google Task data in the following ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Creating Tasks:</strong> Users can create tasks by entering a title, notes, and selecting a task list in
      the extension popup. The extension then uses the Google Tasks API to create a task on your behalf.</li>
    <li><strong>Refreshing Task Lists:</strong> Users can refresh the task lists in the popup to get the latest Google
      Task lists, allowing the extension to read the updated lists.</li>
    <li><strong>Right-Click Menu:</strong> Users can select text on a webpage and create a task using the selected text
      as the title or notes. Users can also create tasks using the webpage title as the task title and the URL as the
      notes through the right-click menu. The right-click menu also displays your Google Task lists, allowing you to
      select a task list when creating tasks from the menu. It also provides an option to refresh the Google Task lists.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>The extension does not store any user data outside the user’s local environment. OAuth tokens and any data accessed
    via the Google API are managed and stored by Google and your browser, not by the extension.</p>

  <h2>User Consent</h2>
  <p>The extension operates with your explicit consent when you grant it access to your Google Task lists through the
    OAuth process. You can revoke this access at any time through your Google account settings.</p>

  <h2>Compliance Disclosure</h2>
  <p><em>(G Task Express)</em>’s use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere
    to <a
      href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes">Google
      API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and we will notify
    users through the extension if significant changes are made.</p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at
